Need pimpl/impl b/c the outside world has handles to the elements.
   One thread could change the element at the same time as another.
   Each transaction needs a copy of the impl, then an action list
   Makes changes to the impls in the baseline.

pimpl/impl allows versioning without action list?

Need an action list b/c a straight merge won't work w/o merge rules?

Merge rules:
o add element: just add
o remove element: just remove? (cascade edges)
o add/set property: set if element exists
o remove property: just add if element exists

Merge order:
1. remove edges
2. remove vertices
3. add vertices
4. add edges
5. remove properties (if element exists)
6. set properties (if element exists)


// ================
Purely partitioned graph, single-threaded
Keep revision in mutated/deleted list of impl copies, can
    apply change with a simple merge.
Need an action list for write-behind to SOR.
